    <p>I am a PhD student studying software engineering at Kent State Universty. My advisor is Dr. Jonathan I. Maletic and I am part of the Software Development Laboratory < SDML > and the srcML team.</p> 

    <p>My primary interest are in static identifier analysis and program transformation. I am interested in making program transformation a regular part of the maintenance cycle by encouraging and easing the use of transformation languages for different types of software maintenance. On the side of static analysis, we have formulated a set of lexical categorizations, similar to English Parts of Speech, for source code. We are using these to analyze patterns in identifier usage. For more information about my research, please visit my publications page. </p>

    <p>I have additionally worked on a number of srcML tools, many of which can be found via www.srcMLorg. All of our public tools are open source, so please check them out.</p>
